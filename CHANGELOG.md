## [0.0.1] - 2018-10-15
### Added
- Requirement 1
  The feature should be implemented to have its own component and link in the menu
- Requirement 2
  The rates will be structured in a JSON format provided by Rasmus, the component should use this file as its data source
- Requirement 3
  There should be a button to send an e-mail with rate information that we currently don’t provide (simply a tag like <a href=”mailto:”> etc.)
- Requirement 4
  The user/artist would be able to filter, in columns of stations, cities, countries, regions as well as a directory of the current rates (stockxchange)
- Requirement 5
  The look of the filters would be same as the ones used across the application, for example on the radio station component or on the radio plays table. The CSS is already written
- Requirement 6
  If the user has more songs, it should be possible to see total value of selected or all songs. The songs the user wants to be included should be selected in checkboxes.
- Requirement 7
  The result should be visualized in a table with the following columns: artist, song, number of plays, duration, rate, and how much money it is. At the bottom of the table there should a “Total” section that shows how much it’s all worth when put together. There are pre-existing CSS classes for table we already use for example in the radio stations component.
